        <p>You squeeze between the icy slabs and through the ruined wall. The frigid wind is now only a dull whisper. A
            humid warmth envolops you. After only a few moments you find yourself having to unbutton your heavy coat.
        </p>
        <p>
            Entering this room feels like stepping into a different world. The icy walls have been replaced with a
            thriving jungle, teeming with life. Tall trees reach for the ceiling, their branches intertwining to create
            a natural canopy. The air is thick with humidity, and the ground is carpeted with moss and ferns.
            The ambient sounds of chirping insects and distant waterfalls fill the room, transporting you far from the
            cold mountain range.
        </p>
        <p>
            There is an icy hole in the west wall. There is an open door in the south wall.
